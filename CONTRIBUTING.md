# Contributing to {{site.title}}
This document is a set of guidelines for contributing to HorseGeneAnnotation on GitHub. 
These are guidelines, not rules. This guide is meant to make it easy for you to get involved.

* [Participation guidelines](#participation-guidelines)

* [How to submit changes](#how-to-submit-changes)

### Getting Started
First of all, **thank you** for your interest in contributing to our project :tada:! 

HorseGeneAnnotation is a community based gene curation website focused on improving the annotation of genes
in non-model and agricultural species -- starting with the horse!

> What does this mean?

[Genes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene) are the primary 
unit of study in genetics. In non-model and agricultural organisms, such as the
horse, genes are identified within the genome using an automated workflow of
computer programs. These auto-generated lists of gene and their known or
suspected structures and DNA sequences often contain errors that need to be
manually fixed. This website will teach people how to do this, present them
with troublesome regions, and then solicit curation in a crowd-sourced manner!

> I am a **scientist/programmer/designer/educator** and I want to help, how do I get started?

This project is meant to mash up many different disciplines, both technical and non-technical! We chose to 
use Github as a central place to host our project (i.e. a repository of information) because of the great 
tools that github offers for collaboration. While Github is a great place for programmers and developers, 
but we understand if it's a little easy to get lost. There is a semi-steep learning curve for getting started...

The good news is that the learning curve is very short and there are [TONS of guides](https://guides.github.com/) 
for how to use and contribute using github. The other perk of using github as a content management system is that
you almost **cannot goof anything up**. All changes to a project are recorded and there is an infinitely deep undo
button. So experiment away!

We are also here to help! The best way to get help is to contact someone
working on the project. We have a live chat room which you can ask any question
in. Just click this badge and join the conversation: [![Gitter chat](https://badges.gitter.im/gitterHQ/gitter.png)](https://gitter.im/HorseGeneAnnotation)

If you would rather experiment yourself, click the Issues tab at the top of the page or follow this [link](https://github.com/UMN-EGGL/HorseGeneAnnotation/issues) to see our list of things we are working on. You can filter the list of tasks by clicking each tag and reducing the issues to ones that might suit you!


## Participation guidelines
This project adheres to a [code of conduct](/conduct/). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to <rob@linkage.io>.

## What we're working on
Take a look at the issues in our [sprint milestone](https://github.com/UMN-EGGL/HorseGeneAnnotation/milestone/1) or browse some [good first bugs](https://github.com/UMN-EGGL/HorseGeneAnnotation/labels/good%20first%20issue) to get started!

In general, our workflow is split into three main project areas.
1. Tutorials, content and documentation
1. Backend Code (Python)
1. Frontend Code (Javascript)

Each project has its own [page with tasks and issues](https://github.com/UMN-EGGL/HorseGeneAnnotation/projects) related 
to each project area. In general, project developments will be outlined as: (1), contributions to tutorials or content
that will then be; (2), implemented on the backend, where changes will be incorporated in the database, the internal program 
logic will be built, and the content will be created; and then (3), the changes will be implemented as an interface on the frontend
using javascript to render the webpage and to interact with the database.

For a high level roadmap on the objectives in each project, please visit each projects respective 
1. [Tutorials, etc Roadmap](https://github.com/UMN-EGGL/HorseGeneAnnotation/issues/3)
1. [Backend Roadmap](https://github.com/UMN-EGGL/HorseGeneAnnotation/issues/4)
1. [Frontend Roadmap](https://github.com/UMN-EGGL/HorseGeneAnnotation/issues/5)

Current issues and tasks related to each project area and discussion on each component can be found in the respective roadmaps.
Please visit each project areas roadmap or [filter the issue tracker](https://github.com/UMN-EGGL/HorseGeneAnnotation/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3ARoadmap) for more information on each project area.


## How to submit changes
Once you've identified one of the issues above that you feel you can contribute to, you're ready to make a change to the project repository!

Working on a website together is difficult. It is easy to step on each others feet :feet:
 
1. **[Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository**. This makes your own version of this project you can edit and use.
1. **[Make your changes](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#making-changes)**! You can do this in the GitHub interface on your own local machine. Once you're happy with your changes...
1. **Submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/proposing-changes-to-a-project-with-pull-requests/)**. This opens a discussion around your project and lets the project lead know you are proposing changes.

## How to report bugs

<!-- Ask your contributors to stay on the lookout for can any potential issue that might cause problems for the project. These could be problems in code (if you’re creating software), content omissions or copy errors (if you’re creating a learning resource), or any issues with the functionality or design of your project. 
Most projects invite all contributors to report bugs, so "debugging" or fixing problems happens quickly and with the input of the community. Take a look at [Atom's example](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#reporting-bugs) for how to teach people to report bugs to your project. -->

Notice a mistake? Please file any bugs, requests, or questions in our [issue tracker](https://github.com/UMN-EGGL/HorseGeneAnnotation/issues)!

<!-- // maybe add  this back when I can figure out gitter ..
## Communication channels

Do you have a chat room or email list you use to discuss this project? List them all here! Provide clear contact info, and outline the process for getting in touch, for anyone with questions.
