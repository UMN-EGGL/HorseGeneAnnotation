# WORKSHEET

Thank you for taking the time to help participate in this project.  As you are working through the tutorial we would like you 
to consider the following questions and provide feedback on your experience.  This will allow us to improve the content of 
the tutorial to serve future users and make sure that the neccesary background information is provided. 

## General Questions
1. Were there any words used in the tutorial that were not properly explained or were confusing?  If able, please list the
words and where you found them in the tutorial. 



2. Did you find any steps difficult to complete with the provided text and images?  Please elaborate on which steps were
confusing and anything you would have liked explained better. 



3. Were you able to locate the genes and all of the neccesary exon information (transcripts, length, splice sites, stop/start
codons, 5' and 3' UTR) to proceed through the tutorial appropriately?  


4. Did you find the images/figures helpful to work through "Tutorial" and "What is Gene Annotation".  Anything you would like
to see clarified? 


## Gene Specific Questions

- Are all splice junctions appropriate?
- Does it contain a 5' and 3' UTR?


_**SLC6A**_
- Number of exons:
