# Welcome! üê¥

This is the README file for {{site.title}}: a manually-curated,
crowd-sourced gene annotation website for the horse. This repo contains all of
the source code, documentation, tutorials, and project tracking for the
HorseGeneAnnotation project. 


This project is meant to empower *anyone* to contribute. There are many ways
to get involved. Here are a couple of steps to get started!

1. Read an overview about the problem we are trying to solve: [here](_pages/problem.md)
1. Read more about the specifics of gene annotation: [here](_pages/What_is_Gene_Annotation.md)
1. Read through our NCBI Based tutorial on how to annotate genes: [here](_pages/NCBI_tutorial.md)
1. Use our web based gene annotation program to help hack the horse genome (coming soon!)
1. Edit/remix/join the conversation and help us make this website better [here](CONTRIBUTING.md)
